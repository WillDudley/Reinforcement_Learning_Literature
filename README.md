### [MLOps](https://github.com/visenger/awesome-mlops)
![MLOps](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/visenger/awesome-mlops)

MLOps is about the implementation of machine learning (eg. image classification) from conception to deployment. In other words, it is "full-stack ML". If one is looking for possible resources to enhance their RL stack, this resource may provide inspiration. This is currently the closest thing industry has to using RL solutions cleanly in production.
